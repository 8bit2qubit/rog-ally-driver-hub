## ü§î How It Works

This tool operates without a backend by leveraging a clever client-side workflow:

1.  **Proxies Requests**: Uses a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) proxy to bypass browser security policies, allowing it to fetch data from `asus.com`.
2.  **Scrapes the Page**: When a device is selected, the app fetches the HTML from the official ASUS support page.
3.  **Constructs API URL**: The HTML is parsed with Regular Expressions to extract the necessary parameters (like product IDs) to build a valid URL for ASUS's internal driver API.
4.  **Fetches Driver Data**: A second request is made to the newly constructed API URL, retrieving the complete driver list in JSON format.
5.  **Renders the UI**: The fetched JSON data is then used to dynamically build and render the categorized, sorted, and highlighted driver list on the page.

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Development

To get this project running on your local machine, follow these steps.

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/8bit2qubit/rog-ally-driver-hub.git
    cd rog-ally-driver-hub
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    This project uses `npm` to manage the development dependencies.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run for Development**
    This command starts a Vite development server with blazing-fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR). Any changes you make in the `src` directory will be instantly reflected in your browser.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  **Build for Production**
    When you are ready to deploy, run this command to generate a single, optimized `index.html` file in the `dist` folder. All JavaScript and CSS are inlined into the file, making it completely self-contained.
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

5.  **Preview the Production Build**
    This command starts a local server to preview the production-ready files from the `dist` folder.
    ```bash
    npm run preview
    ```
    Alternatively, since the build output is a single, self-contained HTML file, you can also open `dist/index.html` directly in your browser to preview it.
